### FAQ
**Q:** I need more ammo.<br/>
**A:** Spawn it in the Q menu's Entites->RAGE tab<br/><br/>

**Q:** How do I switch ammo types?<br/>
**A:**  Make sure you have the key bound, it's *N* by default. Go to your Q menu->Options->RAGE Client Settings, and bind the key. Alternatively, change the value of *cl_buu_rage_ammobutton* in your console.<br/><br/>

**Q:** How do I use Wingsticks?<br/>
**A:** Pick one up from the entities tab. Make sure you have the throwing key bound, it's *G* by default. Go to your Q menu->Options->RAGE Client Settings, and bind the key. Alternatively, change the value of *cl_buu_rage_wingstickbutton* in your console.<br/><br/>

**Q:** Wow I remember that RAGE had some really bad texture popping, but after that the textures looked fine. Why are these so blurry?<br/>
**A:** I scaled down the textures, because the originals made this mod 1GB in size. If you want the uncrunched textures, go to the branches, and selected the Uncrunched Branch <br/><br/>

**Q:** Will you add things like the RC Bomb Car or the Advanced Wingsticks?<br/>
**A:** Probably not. You never know...<br/><br/>

**Q:** GMod says "RAGE SWEPs" is creating script errors!<br/>
